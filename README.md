## About

This is the Apolyton version of *Call to Power II* source code based on the released source code of Call to Power II, without the patch. It has been stripped of comments, but is otherwise complete as far as Activision code goes. It was originally built using Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0. In the mean time the Apolyton code was modified so that it works with the .NET compiler as well.
This version build on Linux (i386 and x86_64), Pandora and Pyra.

Note that datas are not include in this repo, you'll need to get it from Original CD or from GoG version.
